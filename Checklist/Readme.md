# Checklist by Brianne Byer
## First Milestone

The purpose of this Readme is to demonstrate how I have completed the assignment.
I will explain each step, how it was implemented and what I learned.

### 15/3/23
Created the Readme by clicking File/New/File and choosing Empty for Documentation Template.
Created a list, called studyTasks, with 4 values (goals).
Used VStack, which formats objects vertically, to show each goal in studyTasks

Added the associated course to each goal into studyTasks list
Used HStack, which formats objects vertically, to show each goal with its respective course.
Added Image, tick boxes to certain goals, but since I didn't have index[2] for certain goals, a Fatal error occured. Meaning I require an image/index[2] for each goal.
