# Checklist by Brianne Byer
## First Milestone

The purpose of this Readme is to demonstrate how I have completed the assignment.
I will explain each step, how it was implemented and what I learned.

### 15/3/23
Created the Readme by clicking File/New/File and choosing Empty for Documentation Template.
Created a list, called studyTasks, with 4 values (goals).
Used VStack, which formats objects vertically, to show each goal in studyTasks
